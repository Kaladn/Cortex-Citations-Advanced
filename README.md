Validation Module





This module provides functionality to validate extracted entities from citations. It ensures that the data conforms to predefined rules based on the citation type (e.g., article, book). The validation checks include year range validation, category-specific validation, and general validation rules.

Usage

The validate_entities function is the main entry point for validation. It takes a dictionary of entities and the category of the citation as input and returns a list of error messages if any validation rules are violated.

Basic Example

entities = {
    "author": "Doe, J.",
    "title": "Example Title",
    "year": "2023",
    "journal": "Journal of Information Science",
}
category = "article"

errors = validate_entities(entities, category)
if errors:
    print("Validation errors:", errors)
else:
    print("Validation passed.")

Advanced Example

For handling edge cases or incomplete data:

entities = {
    "author": "",
    "title": "Short Title",
    "year": "2030", # Invalid year
    "journal": ""
}
category = "article"

errors = validate_entities(entities, category)
print(errors) # Output: List of validation errors


---

Key Features

Year Validation: Ensures the year is within a valid range (1800–2024).

Category-Specific Validation: Checks for required fields based on the citation category (e.g., author, title, journal for articles).

General Validation Rules: Includes checks such as title length, capitalization, and field completeness.



---

Future Enhancements

Extend validation rules for additional citation categories (e.g., books, conference proceedings).

Integrate with a database or API for dynamic rule updates.

Provide detailed error messages with actionable suggestions for correction.

Main Processing Script

This script serves as the central processing pipeline for citations. It integrates various modules to extract, validate, enrich, standardize, and store citations. The script demonstrates how to process a single citation through these steps and provides detailed logging for each stage.


---

Usage

The process_citation function is the main entry point for processing a citation. It takes raw citation text as input and processes it through the pipeline. The following example demonstrates its use:

citation_text = "Doe, J. (2022). A study of citations. Journal of Information Science, 10(2), 123-145."
process_citation(citation_text)


---

Key Features

Integration with Modules: Leverages modular components for:

Entity Extraction: Parses raw citation text into structured fields.

Validation: Ensures compliance with predefined rules.

Enrichment: Enhances citation data with additional metadata.

Standardization: Formats citations uniformly.

Database Storage: Saves processed citations for easy retrieval.


Detailed Logging: Logs each step for effective debugging and monitoring.

Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures smooth processing, even for incomplete or malformed citations.



---

Future Enhancements

Expand the pipeline to handle diverse citation categories dynamically.

Implement parallel processing for handling multiple citations simultaneously, improving efficiency.

Integrate with a user-friendly interface for real-time citation processing and management.
